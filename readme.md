# Introduction
This is for statistics learning. I will list some learning materials (books, videos, MOOCs) here and also practice some codes.

# BOOKS
1. James, G, Witten, D, Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R. (2013). An Introduction of Statistical Learning, with applications in R. Springer. (online version: https://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)
2. Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R, Friedman, J. (2009). The Elements of Statistical Learning. 2nd edition, (2009). Springer. (oneline version: https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)

These two books(ISTL and ESL) mainly focus on mathmetical derivations and can be used as tool books.

3. Machine Learning in Action (online version: http://www2.ift.ulaval.ca/~chaib/IFT-4102-7025/public_html/Fichiers/Machine_Learning_in_Action.pdf)

This book focus on codes implementation for most common machine learning methods in Python. 

4. Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow (online version: https://cloud.moezx.cc/Document/Hands-On%20Machine%20Learning%20with%20Scikit-Learn%20and%20TensorFlow.pdf)

This books focus on how to use the packages in scikit-learn and tensorflow, which are more straightforward.
